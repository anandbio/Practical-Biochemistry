## Carbohydrates

### Molish Test

Molish test is a group test for all carbohydrates either free or bound to proteins and lipids.

**Principle:** 
The reaction is based on the fact that concentrated acid catalyses the dehydration of sugars to form furfural (from pentoses) or hydroxymethyl furfural (from hexoses). Either of these aldehydes condenses with two molecules of napthol to form a purple or violet colored complex at the interface of the acid and test layer. If the carbohydrate is a poly- or disaccharide, a glycoprotein or a glycolipid, the acid first hydrolyses it into component monosaccharides, which get dehydrated to form furfural or its derivatives.

![molish reaction](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\molish.PNG)

**Procedure:** 

1. Add 2-3 drops of α-napthol solution to 2 ml each of water (blank/negative control), 2% glucose solution (positive control) and test sample in a test tube and mix.
2. Hold the test tube in inclined position and gently add 1 ml H2SO4 along the wall of the test tube (do not mix).

**Note:**

1. Trioses and tetroses do not have the necessary five carbon atoms for furfural formation so they do not give positive result for this reaction.
2. Molish test is not a specific test for carbohydrates. Furfurals as such or furfural yielding substance, some organic acids like citric acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, formic acid etc, can give a positive test.
3. A red ring may form if a concentrated sugar solution is used. This may be due to partial charring of the sugar by the acid. 
4. A black ring may form if conc. H2SO4 is not added very slowly. This can be due to the heat generated during the reaction, which can char the carbohydrates.
5. A green ring may form due to certain impurities in the reagent interacting with αnapthol and the acid.
6. α-napthol solution is unstable and should be prepared fresh. 7. The test tube should be completely dry.


### Iodine Test

Iodine test is used to distinguish mono- or disaccharides from certain polysaccharides like amylose, dextrin and glycogen.

**Principle:**

Iodine test is based on the fact that polyiodide ions form colored adsorption complex with helical chains of glucose residues of amylose (blue-black), dextrin (purple) or glycogen (reddish-brown). Monosaccharides, disaccharides and branched polysaccharides like cellulose remain colorless. Amylopectin produces an orange-yellow hue. The reagent used in iodine test is Lugol’s iodine, which is an aqueous solution of elemental iodine and potassium iodide. Iodine on its own is insoluble in water. Addition of potassium iodide results in reversible reaction of the iodide ion with iodine to form triiodide ion, which further reacts with an iodine molecule to form pentaiodide ion. Bench iodine solution appears brown, whereas, the iodide, triiodide and pentaiodide ions are colorless. Many details of how exactly the color during this test is developed are still unknown. It is observed that the helix (coil or spring) structure of the glucose chain is the key to this test. Further, the resulting color depends on the length of the glucose chains. The triiodide and pentaiodide ions formed are linear and slip inside the helix structure. It is believed that transfer of charge between the helix and the polyiodide ions results in changes in the spacing of the energy levels, which can absorb visible light, giving the complex its color.

![Iodine test](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\iodine_starch.png)

**Procedure:**

1. Add 2-3 drops of Lugol’s solution to 5 ml of solution to be tested. Note: 1. On heating, the blue color amylose-iodine complex disassociates but is formed again on cooling because the helical structure of amylose is disrupted, there by amylose loses its iodine binding capacity and the blue color. The blue color reappears on cooling due to the recovery of iodine binding capacity due to regaining of helical structure.
2. At very low pH amylose undergoes hydrolysis, so it is not recommended to conduct iodine test for amylose under these conditions.
3. The blue color amylose-iodine complex can be detected visually with concentrations of iodine as low as 20 µM at 20 °C.
4. The dextrin-iodine complex disassociates on heating but is not formed again on cooling because the concentration of residual iodine is too low to form complex with dextrin.
5. Presence of proteins (particularly albumin) in the sample may produce false positive results as proteins can compete with starch for binding iodine.


### Benedict’s Test 

Benedict’s test is used to differentiate between reducing and non-reducing sugars.

**Principle:** The carbohydrates having a free or potentially free, aldehyde or ketone group can act as a reducing agent. Benedict’s reagent appears deep blue in color and consists of copper sulphate mixed with sodium citrate and a weak alkali, sodium carbonate. When reducing sugars are heated in the presence of alkali they get converted to enediols, which are powerful reducing agents. Enediols reduce the cupric ions (Cu2+) present in the Benedicts reagent to cuprous ions (Cu+), which get precipitated as insoluble red colored cuprous oxide (Cu2O).The test is semi-quantitative, since the color of the precipitate indicates approximate quantity of the sugar present in the sample. For a sample containing reducing sugar the color of the sample during boiling progress from blue (with no reducing sugar present), green, yellow, orange, red, and then brick red or brown (with high concentration of reducing sugars). The citrate ions form a complex with cupric ions and prevent its precipitation with the hydroxide ions as cupric hydroxide. 

![benedicts reaction](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\benedicts.png)

**Procedure:**

1. Add 0.5-1.0 ml of the test solution to 2 ml of Benedict’s reagent. 
2. Keep the test tubes in boiling water bath for 4-10 min. 

**Note:**

1. Sucrose, starch, inositol gives negative result, whereas lactose and maltose give positive result with Benedict’s reagent.
2. Benedict modified the Fehling’s solution to make an improved single reagent, which is quite stable. It is very sensitive to even small quantities of reducing sugars (0.1%) and yields enough precipitate.
3. False positive reaction for urine sample may be obtained due to presence of reducing substances like uric acid, ascorbic acid (during vitamin supplementation), drugs (levodopa) etc
4. A greenish precipitate indicates about 0.5 g% concentration; yellow precipitate indicates 1 g% concentration; orange indicates 1.5 g% and red indicates 2 g% or higher concentration.


### Barfoed’s Test 

Barfoed’s test is used to detect reducing monosaccharides in the presence of disaccharides.

**Principle:** Barfoed’s reagent consists of copper acetate in dilute acetic acid. Since acidic pH is unfavorable for reduction, monosaccharides, which are stronger reducing agents, react in about 1-2 min, whereas reducing disaccharides take 7-12 min to first get hydrolyzed in the acidic solution and then react. A thin red precipitate is formed at the bottom or sides of the tube. Thus, the difference in reducing strength can be detected.

![barfoeds reaction](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\barfoeds.png)

**Procedure:**

1. Add 3 ml of Barfoed’s reagent to 1 ml of sample. 
2. Keep the test tubes in boiling water bath for 1-2 min only.

**Note:**

1. The boiling should not exceed 1-2 min, otherwise reducing disaccharides may be hydrolyzed and give a positive test result.
2. The disaccharide solutions used for this test should not exceed 1% (w/v).
 
|Glucose | Fructose  | Xylose|Sucrose|Maltose|Galactose|
|------:|:---------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:---------:|:----:|
|**Upto 2 min**     |    +    |     +     |    +  |    -    |-|-|
|**After 7-12 min** |    +    |     +     |    +  |    +    |+|+|


Higher concentration (≥ 5%) gives positive result for disaccharides with Barfoed’s test.
3. Chloride ions interfere with this test. Since urine contains chloride ions Barfoed’s test is not suitable for detection of reducing sugars in urine.


### Seliwanoff’s Test

Seliwanoff’s test is a timed color reaction specific for ketohexoses. It is used to distinguish ketoses from aldoses.

**Principle:**The reagent consists of resorcinol and conc HCl. The acid hydrolyses of polysaccharides and oligosaccharides yields simpler sugars. Ketohexoses undergo dehydration to yield 5-hydroxymethyl furfural more rapidly than aldohexoses. The dehydrated ketose reacts with resorcinol to produce a deep cheery red color complex (not precipitate). Aldoses may react slightly to produce a faint pink to cherry red color.

![selwinoff reaction](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\selwinoff.png)

**Procedure:**

1. Add 2 ml of Seliwanoff’s reagent to 1 ml of sample. 2. Keep in boiling water bath for 1 min. Note: 1. Sucrose and inulin also give this test because these are hydrolysed by acid to give fructose.
2. High concentration of glucose or other sugar may interfere by producing similar colored compounds with seliwanoff reagent.
3. Prolonged boiling can transform glucose to fructose by catalytic action of acid and form cherry red complex.


### Osazone Test 

Osazone test is used to detect reducing sugars.

**Principle:** The reagent consists of phenylhydrazine in acetate buffer. Carbohydrates with free or potentially free carbonyl groups react with phenylhydrazine to form osazone. The condensation-oxidation-condensation reaction between three molecules of phenylhydrazine and carbon one and two of aldoses or ketoses to yields 1,2-diphenyhydrazone, which are known as osazone. Osazone appear as yellow colored crystals of characteristic shape, solubility, melting point and time of formation. Since both carbons 1 and 2 are involved in the reaction C-2 epimers produce the same osazone. Ketoses with configurations identical to aldoses below C-2 give the same osazones e.g. glucose and fructose.

![osazone reaction](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\osazone1.png)


The characteristic features of osazone are given in the following table:

|Carbohydrate (osazone)|Time of formation (min)|Crystalline structure|
|:----:|:----:|:---:|
|Fructosazone |2|Needle shape |
|Glucosazone |5|Needle shape|
|Galactosazone|20| Thorny ball shape |
|Maltosazone |30-45|Sunflower/Star shape|
|Lactosazone|30-45|Cotton ball/Powder puff shape|

**Procedure:**

1. Add 0.3 g of osazone mixture and 5 drops of glacial acetic acid to 5 ml of sample in each of the test tubes and mix well (warm gently if required to dissolve the contents).
2. Keep the test tube in boiling water bath and observe for formation of crystal at various time points indicated in the observation table.
3. Observe the shape of the crystal under low magnification. 

**Note:**
1. This is the only test to distinguish lactose from maltose during identification of unknown sugars.
2. Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar but it forms osazone on boiling for 30 min. Maltose and Lactose form osazone after boiling the sample for more than 2 hrs.
3. Osazones of monosaccharides are insoluble in hot solution unlike those of disacchrides. 4. After incubating the tubes in boiling water bath for 30 min, the osazone solution should be allowed to cool gradually to room temperature to facilitate proper formation of the crystals. Tubes should not be cooled under running tap water or on ice.
5. Sodium acetate and acetic acid together function as acetate buffer and maintain the pH at 5, which is proper for the formation of osazones. If excess acetic acid is added, the pH of the reaction reduces further resulting in the hydrolysis of disaccharides to monosacharides, which then form osazones insoluble in hot solution.


### Athrone Test

Anthrone method is a group test for carbohydrates. It is a rapid and convenient method for quantification of carbohydrates either free or bound to proteins and lipids.

**Principle:**If the carbohydrate is a poly- or disaccharide, a glycoprotein or a glycolipid, the concentrated acid present in anthrone reagent first hydrolyses it into component monosaccharides. Further the concentrated acid catalyses the dehydration of sugars to form furfural (from pentoses) or hydroxymethyl furfural (from hexoses). Either of these aldehydes condenses with two molecules of napthol to form a bluish green complex, which is quantified by measuring absorbance at 620 nm in a spectrophotometer or using red filter in a colorimeter.

![anthrone reaction](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\anthrone2.png)

**Reagents:** Dissolve 2 g anthrone in 50 ml conc. H2SO4, makeup to 100 ml with conc. H2SO4.

**Procedure:** 

1. Setup and process the standard (glucose), blank and unknown sample as described in the table below.
![anthrone table](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\anthrone3.png)
2. Measure absorbance at 620 nm in spectrophotometer or in colorimeter using red filter. Use the blank to set absorbance to zero then measure absorbance of each tube.
3. Plot a standard curve using absorbance values of serial dilutions of glucose. (X-axis: sugar concentration in µg/ml; Y-axis: absorbance at 620 nm). Based on the standard curve determine carbohydrate content in unknown sample.

**Note:**

1. Anthrone test is not a specific test for carbohydrates. Furfurals as such and furfural yielding substance, some organic acids like citric acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, formic acid etc, can give a positive test.
2. If the sample contains proteins with large number of tryptophan residues, the reaction produces red color.


### Dinitrosalicylic acid Method

Dinitrosalicylic acid (DNSA) method is used for estimating the concentration of reducing sugars in a sample.

**Principle:** The carbohydrates having a free or potentially free, aldehyde or ketone group can act as reducing agents. The DNSA reagent is an alkaline solution of 3,5dinitrosalicyclic acid and tartarate salt. On heating the reducing sugars can reduce 3,5dinitrosalicyclic acid to 3-amino-5-nitrosalicyclic acid, which appears orange-red in color. The intensity of the color is proportional to amount of reducing sugar present in the sample. The orange color developed is compared to standards in a spectrophotometer at 540 nm.

![dinitrosalicilic reaction](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\dnsa.png)

**Reagents:** Dissolve 30 g potassium sodium tartarate in 50 ml water and add 20 ml 2 M NaOH. Mix well, add 1 g DNSA powder and make up to 100 ml with H2O

**Procedure:**

1. Setup and process the standard (glucose), blank and unknown sample as described in the table below.

![dinitrosalicilic table](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\dnsa2.png)
2. Measure absorbance at 540 nm in spectrophotometer. Use the blank to set absorbance to zero then measure absorbance of each tube.
3. Plot a standard curve using absorbance values of serial dilutions of glucose. (Xaxis: sugar concentration in µg/ml; Y-axis: absorbance at 540 nm). Based on the standard curve determine carbohydrate content in unknown sample.

**Note:**

1. Different sugars give different color yields. The method is therefore not suitable for the determination of a complex mixture of reducing sugars.
2. The DNSA method is simple, sensitive and adaptable to large sample size.


### Roe’s method

The Roe’s method is a modified Selod and is generally used to determine the concentration of fructose in a given sample.

**Principle:** Ketosugars undergo rapid dehydration to hydroxymethyl furfural than aldo sugars. The hydroxymethyl furfural formed later condenses with resorcinol to give a pink colored complex (λmax
520 nm).


**Reagents:** (i) Standard fructose stock solution (1 mg/ml): weigh 100 mg of fructose and transfer it into a 100 ml volumetric flask. Make up the volume to 100 ml with distilled water. (ii) Working standard fructose solution (100 µg/ml): dilute 10 ml of the stock solution to 100 ml with distilled water in a volumetric flask. (iii) Resorcinol reagent: resorcinol (0.1% w/v) and thiourea (0.25% w/v) in glacial acetic acid. (iv) Dilute HCl: mix concentrated hydrochloric acid and distilled water in the ratio of 5:1 

**Procedure:**

1. Setup and process the standard (glucose), blank and unknown sample as described in the table below.

![roes](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\roes.png)

2. Measure absorbance at 520 nm in spectrophotometer. Use the blank to set absorbance to zero then measure absorbance of each tube.
3. Plot a standard curve using absorbance values of serial dilutions of fructose. (Xaxis: sugar concentration in µg/ml; Y-axis: absorbance at 520 nm). Based on the standard curve determine carbohydrate content in unknown sample (remember to take the dilution factor into account).


### Fehling’s test 

Fehling’s test is used to differentiate between reducing and non-reducing sugars.

**Principle:** The carbohydrates having a free or potentially free, aldehyde or ketone group can act as reducing agents. Fehling’s reagent appears deep blue in color and consists of copper sulphate mixed with potassium sodium tartarate and a strong alkali, usually, sodium hydroxide. On heating the sample in presence of Fehling’s solution, bistartarocuprate(II) complex oxidizes the aldoses to corresponding aldonic acids, and in the process the copper(II) ions of the complex are reduced to insoluble yellow or red color precipitate of cuprous(I) oxide(Cu2 yield shorter chain acids. 

![fehling](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\fehling1.png)

The tartarate ions prevent the formation of insoluble Cu(OH)2 from the reaction of CuSO4.5H2O and NaOH present in the solution by forming bistartaratocuprate(II) complex. This complex releases cupric ions slowly for reduction thus preventing the formation of black cupric oxide. If Fehling’s solution is heated in the absence of reducing sugars it forms black precipitate of cupric oxide.

![fehling](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\fehling2.png)

**Reagents:** Fehling’s solution A- Dissolve 7.0 g of CuSO4 .7H2O in 100 ml H2 O. Fehling’s solution B- Dissolve 24.0 g of KOH and 34.6 g of potassium sodium tartarate in 100 ml H2O. Fehling’s reagent- Mix equal volumes of A and B solution just before use.

**Procedure:**

1. Add 1 ml of Fehling’s reagent to 1 ml of test solution and mix well. 
2. Place the test tube in boiling water bath for 2-3 min. 

**Note:**

1. Fehling’s test gives positive result for aldo monosaccharides (due to presence of oxidizable aldehyde group) and also for keto monosaccharides, since they are converted to aldoses by the base in the reagent.
2. Sucrose does not react with Fehling’s reagent because the anomeric carbon of glucose is involved in glycosidic bond formation (free form of aldehyde is not present). Lactose and Maltose are reducing sugars. The reducing sugars e.g. glucose get oxidized because glucose exists in aqueous solution in three different forms (two cyclic and one noncyclic). The non-cyclic is the least common but it is present in small amount. This form has an aldehydic group at the end of the chain and is the group that is oxidized. As the aldehyde form gets oxidized, more of the non-cyclic form is produced due to Le Chatelier's principle.
3. Fehling’s is used to determine dextrose equivalents for the conversion of starch to glucose syrup.
4. Compounds other than reducing sugars also test positive to this test, e.g. chloroform, ammonium salts. Formic acid is readily oxidized to carbon dioxide and water and gives positive Fehling’s test result.
5. Fehling’s can be used to screen for glucose in urine, to detect diabetes. Since cuprous oxide is dissolved by ammonia, it is not possible to detect small quantities of reducing sugars in fluids like urine, which are saturated with ammonia.


### Somogyi-Nelson method

Somogyi-Nelson method is used for quantitative determination of relatively pure sample of reducing sugars.

**Principle:** The carbohydrates having a free or potentially free, aldehyde or ketone group can act as reducing agents. Alkaline copper tartarate is the active reagent in SomogyiNelson method. When a reducing sugar is heated in an alkaline solution of copper tartarate, cuprous oxide is produced, which in turn reacts with arsenomolybdate to give molybdenum blue. The blue color developed is compared to standards in a spectrophotometer at 620 nm. The presence of sodium sulfate in the reaction mixture prevents reoxidation of cuprous oxide by atmospheric oxygen. Reagents: Dissolve 1.5 g copper sulfate in a small volume of distilled water. Add one drop of sulfuric acid and make up to 10 ml. 

**Procedure:**

1. Add 1 ml alkaline copper reagent to each of the 1 ml standard, blank and sample. 2. Place the tubes in a boiling water bath for 10 min. 
3. Let the tubes cool down, then add 1 ml arsenomolybdate reagent. 
4. Make up the volume to 10 ml with water. 
5. After 10 min, read the absorbance at 620 nm. 

**Note:**

1. Since different reducing sugars produce blue colored product of various intensities, this method is not suitable for mixture of reducing sugars.
2. Proteins interfere with this reaction. Samples can be deproteinated by zinc hydroxide precipitation.


### Mucic acid test 

Mucic acid test is used to detect the presence of galactose.

**Principle:** Monosaccharides upon treating with strong oxidizing agents such as nitric acid yield saccharic acids. Nitric acid has the capacity to xidize both aldehyde and primary alcoholic groups present at C1 and C6 respectively of galactose to yield an insoluble precipiate (rod shaped crystals) of mucic acid and thus the name of the test. Galactose containing saccharides test positive to this reaction.

![mucic](C:\Users\anand tiwari\Documents\mucic.png)

**Reagent:** conc. Nitric acid. Sugar solution: galactose (2% w/v in distilled water).

**Procedure:**

1. Add 2 ml of conc. nitric acid slowely to 5 ml of the galactose solution in a small beaker. 
2. Heat over a flame (cautiously) till the volume is reduced to about 2-3 ml. 
3. Gradually cool the solution to room temperature.
