# About the book

There is a growing need for a reference book of this type due to curriculum modularization in various disciplines of Life Science at all levels and in all areas of Biochemistry. The “Practical Biochemistry: A Student Companion” is intended to bridge this gap. The author draw on his teaching and research experience to provide reference book for both under graduate and graduate students taking Biochemistry as well as young researchers in life and teachers of Biochemistry. This book has three parts: Part I deal with identification and quantitative determination of carbohydrates, lipids, amino acids, proteins and nucleic acids. Part II includes enzyme assays and Part III covers various bioanalytical techniques. The book is written in a lucid way with several chemical equations and illustrations.
